<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Aware Office leverages temperature sensors to enhance existing presence services in office environments.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Office IT infrastructure generally has limited or no live knowledge of locations of personnel within a building. Availability of this information provides straightforward benefit for collaborating coworkers who need to find each other. It is also applicable to information security, allowing unattended devices to lock themselves with a greater degree of accuracy than monitoring keyboard and mouse activity.</p>

<h2>Use Case: Team Agility</h2>

<p>A software company's IT group installs Aware Office sensors at each of its employees' workstations, and uses it to automatically control screen locking and Jabber status.</p>

<p>When Alice is working at her desk but not actively using her workstation, she used to be annoyed that both of her computers would automatically lock after a few minutes in accordance with the company's security policy. Now that Aware Office is in charge of detection, her mere presence at the desk is sufficient to keep the machine unlocked.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob need to confer often with their coworkers, so they leave their desks frequently. Accurate presence detection means they won't waste their time walking to each others' offices to find that no one is there.</p>

<h2>Use Case: Office Hours</h2>

<p>Professor Brown holds office hours from 3:00 to 4:00. At 3:30, he leaves to use the restroom, not bothering to leave behind any indication of brevity of the absence. His student Martin shows up several minutes later. Without Aware Office, Martin might simply leave, angry and frustrated at the apparent lack of professorial availability.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the student has some hint to the Dr. Brown's location. The course webpage, in addition to listing the date and times of office hours, also provides a hyperlink to the Aware Office page for the professor's office. Martin can view this from any web-enabled mobile device, and is informed that the professor was last seen in the office just a few minutes ago. Furthermore, the student now has the option of watching this status remotely, rather than needing to stand waiting at the office door.</p>

<h2>Business Viability</h2>

<p>Aware Office boosts productivity in sizeable organizations by facilitating collaboration among colleagues. Aware Office also promotes security. A few commercial office-oriented human detection solutions exist, but desktop sensors have not yet seen wide adoption. Currently, both screen locking and presence reporting are done manually or by timeouts. This strategy has proven mostly sufficient </p>

<p>We estimate that hardware and software for an office-wide Aware Office installation might be sold for $200 per workstation. The key to making this product marketable will be providing full integration with the platforms and software that businesses are already utilizing, and we have found no existing products that offer well-integrated solutions.</p>

<h2>Prototype Architecture</h2>

<table class="arch">
<tr>
<td class="text">
<p>The unique component of Aware Office is the method of human detection. Our prototype uses a small infrared temperature sensor produced by Phidgets Inc. which can be purchased in bulk for $75 per sensor. The device has a USB interface and is accessed via a Python library provided by Phidgets.</p>
<p>To protected against reporting a false "away" status, we also combine the sensor data with keyboard and mouse activity. Our prototype machines run Linux with the Gnome desktop.</p>
<p>The collected data is represented as a sequence of timestamped events which get sent to the persistence layer.</p>

<p>The client collects events in a database so this information can be retrieved by the services which perform chat status updates and screen locking. We chose SQLite for prototype development, with the intent of dropping in a different DBMS later for a real deployment.</p>
<p>The Aware Office client can run by itself, but is more powerful when paired with a central server. The client reports events to the server, where they are copied into another database. The server aggregates the data it receives and runs a web application to display the current status of every client. All of this traffic is JSON over HTTP.</p>
<p>When the client subscribes to events for a particular user name, information also flows from server to client in the same manner. This allows us to link together multiple workstations under a single identity.</p>

A client machine uses the event data it has collected (either directly from sensors or via the central server) to appropriately manipulate a local chat client and screensaver. As these interactions are software and platform dependent, multiple implementations will be required. In our prototype, both actions are performed using D-Bus, the standard mechanism for interprocess communication on our Linux platform.
