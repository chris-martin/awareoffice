<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Aware Office leverages temperature sensors to enhance existing presence services.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Office IT infrastructure generally has limited or no live knowledge of locations of personnel within a building. Availability of this information provides straightforward benefit for collaborating coworkers who need to find each other. It is also applicable to information security, allowing unattended devices to lock themselves with a greater degree of accuracy than monitoring keyboard and mouse activity.</p>

<h2>Use Case: Team Agility</h2>

<p>A software company's IT group installs Aware Office sensors at each of its employees' workstations, and uses it to automatically control screen locking and Jabber status.</p>

<p>When Alice is working at her desk but not actively using her workstation, she used to be annoyed that both of her computers would automatically lock after a few minutes in accordance with the company's security policy. Now that Aware Office is in charge of detection, her mere presence at the desk is sufficient to keep the machine unlocked.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob need to confer often with their coworkers, so they leave their desks frequently. Accurate presence detection means they won't waste their time walking to each others' offices to find that no one is there.</p>

<h2>Use Case: Office Hours</h2>

<p>Professor Brown holds office hours from 3:00 to 4:00. At 3:30, he leaves to use the restroom, not bothering to leave behind any indication of brevity of the absence. His student Martin shows up several minutes later. Without Aware Office, Martin might simply leave, angry and frustrated at the apparent lack of professorial availability.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the student has some hint to the Dr. Brown's location. The course webpage, in addition to listing the date and times of office hours, also provides a hyperlink to the Aware Office page for the professor's office. Martin can view this from any web-enabled mobile device, and is informed that the professor was last seen in the office just a few minutes ago. Furthermore, the student now has the option of watching this status remotely, rather than needing to stand waiting at the office door.</p>

<h2>Business Case</h2>
...
*business case - not a full business plan
*the ecosystem and how you fit into it
    --target market and pricing
    --competitive solutions - how you compare to the alternatives, these are not always current products but could also just be the        current way that people solve this problem
